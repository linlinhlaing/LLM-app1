# LLM-app1
Create a simple AI powered application using LLMs and LangChain

# LLM App1 Setup

To get started with your LLM (Large Language Model) app, ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai
pip install langchain
pip install langchain-community
pip install langchain-openai

## Getting Started

### Sign Up for OpenAI API Key
You'll need access to the OpenAI API. If you haven't already, sign up for an API key at [OpenAI API]
(https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

### Set Up Your Environment

1. **Step 1:** Obtain your OpenAI API key.
2. **Step 2:** Set your API key as an environment variable.

### Set Temperature

Define the temperature parameter for your LLM. This value can range from 0 to 1.0.
Higher values lead to more creative outputs and a greater chance of "hallucination."
